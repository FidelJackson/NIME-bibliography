Thecore of this proposed controller design is a continuouselectronic tonehole-sensing arrangement, equally applicableto other woodwind interfaces like those of the flute, recorder orJapanese shakuhachi. The controller will initially be used todrive a physically-based synthesis model, with the eventualgoal being the development of a mapping layer allowing theEpipE interface to operate as a MIDI-like controller of arbitrarysynthesis models.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a design principle for the musical instruments that are useful for both novices and professional musicians and that facilitate musically rich expression. We believe that the versatility of conventional musical instruments causes difficulty in performance. By dynamically specializing a musical instrument for performing a specific (genre of) piece, the musical instrument could become more useful for performing the piece and facilitates expressive performance. Based on this idea, we developed two new types of musical instruments, i.e., a "given-melody-based musical instrument" and a "harmonic-function-based musical instrument". From the experimental results using two prototypes, we demonstrate the efficiency of the design principle.}

These physical artifacts, that wecall blocks, are a new type of input device for manipulatingan interactive music system. The blocks' functional andtopological statuses are tightly coupled to an ad hocsequencer, interpreting the user's arrangement of the blocksas meaningful musical phrases and structures.We demonstrate that we have created both a tangible andvisual language that enables both the novice and musicallytrained users by taking advantage of both their explorativeand intuitive abilities. The tangible nature of the blocks andthe intuitive interface promotes face-to-face collaborationand social interaction within a single system. The principleof collaboration is further extended by linking two BlockJam systems together to create a network.We discuss our project vision, design rational, relatedworks, and the implementation of Block Jam prototypes.Figure 1.

The key additions to its core are a flexiblesensor subsystem and multi-channel audio I/O. In contrast toother stand-alone approaches it retains a higher degree offlexibility by supporting popular music programming languages, with Miller Puckette's pd [1] being the current focus.}

Theconcept of this interface is based on the superposition of thegesture spatial place and the visual feedback spatial place; i tgives the impression that the graphical objects are real. Thisconcept enables a huge freedom in designing interfaces. Thegesture device we have created gives the position of fourfingertips using 3D sensors and the data is performed in theMax/MSP environment. We have realized two practicalexamples of musical use of such a device, using PhotosonicSynthesis and Scanned Synthesis.}

The purpose of this model is to construct acoherent and meaningful interaction between performer andinstrument. Such a model has been implicit in previous researchfor interactive performance systems. The model presented heredistinguishes gestural primitives from units of measure ofgestures. The throughput model identifies symmetry betweenperformance gestures and musical gestures, and indicates a rolefor gestural primitives when a performer navigates regions ofstable oscillations in a musical instrument. The use of a highdimensional interface tool is proposed for instrument design, forfine-tuning the mapping between movement sensor data andsound synthesis control data.}
